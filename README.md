## Project Outline

The aim of this website was to convey to the viewer a sense of my personality and technical capability. Colours were used in a pattern as to create a compelling user experience and invoke a sense of playfulness with familiarity and comfort. Overall the design of the website is minimalist with no distractions for the viewer.

## Functionality / Features 

The portfolio features a mobile-first highly responsive design that makes use of rem units to change the elements with each screen size. Allowing for a seamless increase/decrease in size over multiple devices. This was implemented in version 2.0 of the portfolio after leaning lessons from the first build. This will be discussed later. 

Other features include an animated cube on the landing page, one orange side that initiates the presence of that colour. The user will be surprised to find the same colour if they choose to send an email.  

Another feature is the project display window. It allows for simple viewing of projects completed.

Design was tested on multiple family members. This testing provided evidence that the site was initiative and easy to navigate.  

## Project plan & Timeline 

The portfolio underwent three revisions. Initially the design was black and white with an image behind the landing page. It was simple and was built before the start date of the project. 

Upon using Figma and attempting to use a colour palette a major revision was undertaken thus portfolio 2.0 was born. Based around a orange, white and blue design. Portfolio 2.0 was built using CSS grid that covered each page. As the build went on I encountered many problems relating to the responsiveness and making it suitable for mobile. I made the decision on Thursday 21st march so scrap portfolio 2.0 and start from scratch. This time designing mobile first and using what was learnt in the previous builds. This decision was an easy one as it meant writing more code and thus learning more.  

Portfolio 2.1 was built mobile first and relied on flexbox/rem units to achieve a responsive design that suited all screen sizes. After the build was completed the colour scheme was revamped to what is seen in final product.
